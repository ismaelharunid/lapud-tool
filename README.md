# lapud-tool
Lazy Ass Programmer's Unittest and Documentation Tool

Because we sometimes might think we don't have time to do unit testing, documentation, and linting.  But it slows you down if you don't.  But what are computers really good at if not automating process.  The lapud-tool fills that gap.  It will (if I finish building it) take existing code, parse the code, any existing documentation, hinting and comments, and then create your unittest classes, inline documentation, fix your linting errors and optionally walk you through what it did allowing you to accept, reject or tag it for later choices.  So no more excuses, either do it properly or use this tool or save time and do both.

Well, the concept is built.  The start of a sopporting modules and packages and dependencies are also done.  I sort of know how to build it, and I want to build it, and I can build it but I'm probably too lazy, I may never do it.  But never say never.  I hope I do and soon.  Much love.
